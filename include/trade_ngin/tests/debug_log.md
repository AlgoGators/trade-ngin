# Debugging Log for trade-ngin Build Issues

## Current Issue
- Build failing due to namespace conflicts with standard library types
- Error occurs in standard library headers when they try to use unqualified names like `string` and `basic_string`
- Problem appears to be caused by namespace pollution affecting standard library headers

## Attempted Solutions
1. Added explicit `std::` qualifiers to `Logger.hpp` and `Logger.cpp`
   - Result: Still getting errors in standard library headers
   
2. Tried using `using namespace std` in header files
   - Result: Caused more namespace pollution issues

3. Tried removing namespace declarations
   - Result: Did not resolve the core issue

4. Moved namespace declarations after standard library includes
   - Result: Still getting errors in standard library headers
   - Error suggests namespace is still affecting std library internals

5. Cleaned up build directories and tried fresh build
   - Result: Same errors persist
   - Confirmed issue is not related to stale build files

6. Modified IBConnection.cpp to use fully qualified names
   - Result: Still getting errors in standard library headers
   - Error suggests deeper issue with namespace resolution

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be that the standard library's internal headers are being affected by our namespace declarations. Specifically:

1. The standard library headers use unqualified names internally (e.g., `string`, `basic_string`)
2. Our `trade_ngin` namespace is somehow interfering with the std namespace lookup
3. The issue persists even with fully qualified names and proper include order
4. The problem seems to be in how the C++ standard library's internal headers resolve names

## Next Steps to Try
1. Add a compiler flag to isolate namespaces: `-fvisibility=hidden`
2. Try using an inline namespace to prevent ADL issues
3. Consider restructuring the code to minimize namespace interactions:
   - Move Logger class outside any namespace
   - Use implementation files for namespace-specific code
   - Keep headers namespace-neutral where possible

## Files Affected
- `Logger.hpp`
- `Logger.cpp`
- `IBConnection.cpp`
- `IBConnection.hpp`

## Current Strategy
Going to try adding compiler flags to better control namespace visibility and symbol exports.
