## Description

*Trade Engine* is a full-featured trading and backtesting engine that allows users to create, backtest, and analyze trading strategies. The engine is built on top of the idea of allowing for multiple data sources, multiple trading strategies, and multiple backtesting metrics. The engine is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new data sources, trading strategies, and backtesting metrics.

The engine is built using Python and is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend. Some implementations of portfolio optimization and risk management are developed using python bindings in C++ for performance reasons. Other JIT compilation techniques are also used to speed up the backtesting process. The engine is designed to be fast and efficient, allowing for the backtesting of large datasets in a short amount of time.
