# Trading Strategy Debug Log

## Previous Attempts
1. Fixed position initialization
   - Added `pos.in_position = true` when entering new positions
   - Result: Still showed 0 trades

2. Fixed trade counting
   - Added `pos.total_trades++` and `pos.trades++`
   - Result: Now showing trades but P&L calculation issues

3. Fixed P&L calculation
   - Added contract multiplier to P&L calculations
   - Result: Unrealistic P&L values (e.g. $5M+ on British Pound futures)

4. Fixed position sizing
   - Adjusted base size from 0.1% to 0.5% to 1% to 2%
   - Result: Position sizes still seem small relative to capital

## Current Issues
1. Trade tracking works (106 trades recorded)
2. Win rate is very low (7.55%)
3. P&L calculations seem incorrect (unrealistic values)
4. Position sizes may be too small

## Next Steps
1. Let's first verify the trade entry logic:

## Issues Found
1. Double Position Updates
   - The code updates positions in two places:
     a. Inside `updatePosition` function
     b. After calling `updatePosition` in the main loop
   - This could lead to incorrect position tracking and P&L calculation

2. Inconsistent Contract Multiplier Usage
   - Contract multiplier is used in P&L calculation but not in position sizing
   - This causes position sizes to be too large for high-value contracts

3. P&L Calculation Issues
   - Unrealized P&L is calculated twice:
     a. Inside `updatePosition`
     b. At the end of the main loop without using contract multiplier

4. Position Size Calculation Mismatch
   - `getPositionSize` function uses 1% base size
   - `updatePosition` function uses 0.5% base size
   - Main loop uses a different calculation based on capital_per_symbol

## Proposed Fixes
1. Remove duplicate position updates:

## Changes Made (Attempt #1)
1. Fixed Double Position Updates
   - Removed duplicate position updates in main loop
   - Now only updating positions in `updatePosition` function
   - Mock execution is only for logging purposes

2. Fixed Position Size Consistency
   - Changed base size to 1% throughout code
   - Removed `total_trades` counter (was redundant with `trades`)

3. Fixed P&L Calculation
   - Consolidated unrealized P&L updates to one place
   - Always using contract multiplier in P&L calculations
   - Set capital weight to 0 when exiting positions

4. Fixed Position History
   - Recording 0.0 position when exiting trades
   - Removed duplicate history updates

## Expected Improvements
1. More accurate P&L calculations
2. Consistent position sizing
3. Better trade tracking
4. No double counting of trades

Let's run the strategy again to see if these changes improved things:
