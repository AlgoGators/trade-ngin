Email Sending Template Specification
Header
Keep the current date and Daily Trading Report header line.
Just below that, add:
AlgoGators – Trend Following Strategy
Use the image Algo.png (from the root folder) as the AlgoGators symbol in the header.
Positions Table
Keep the positions table, but modify the columns:
If the strategy is a daily strategy, only show the Market Price column.
Otherwise, show both Market Price and Average Price.
This logic should be controlled by a flag in the email sending service.
Keep the existing formatting for the rest of the lines.
Example summary lines below the table:
Active Positions: 10  
Total Notional: $286,382  
Total Margin Posted: $64,677  
Executions Table
Leave this exactly as it is.
Footer
If the strategy is a daily strategy, include the following note:
This strategy is based on daily OHLCV data. For execution, it assumes that all orders are filled at the day's opening price, meaning the average execution price is treated as equal to the daily market open.
Always end the email with:
